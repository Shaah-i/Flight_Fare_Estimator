About_Shubham = """Greetings, I'm Shubham, a data enthusiast and aspiring data scientist
with a passion for exploring new datasets and uncovering insights. 
I've spent a few years actively learning and contributing to the data 
community, always on the lookout for new projects and collaborations 
that will challenge and grow my skills.

Along with my love of data, I also enjoy exploring the creative arts. 
Origami and photography are my favorite pastimes, and I'm always 
eager to find new ways to express myself visually. I also have a keen 
interest in marketing strategies, as I find it fascinating to see how
data can be leveraged to drive business decisions.
    
With a background in Mechanical Engineering and several years of 
experience in design and manufacturing, I bring a unique perspective 
to my work. I strive to apply the principles of engineering design to 
data-driven problem solving, emphasizing the importance of precision, 
efficiency, and innovation.
    
If you're interested in discussing a potential collaboration or would 
like to learn more about my work, feel free to reach out to me on my
